# Noteblocks (REAL\_NOTE)

Already placed Noteblocks (before ItemsAdder installation) may be shown with custom blocks textures.

{% hint style="info" %}
This is only a graphical glitch and will be fixes as soon as you make the Noteblocks play (interacting or using redstone).
{% endhint %}

## How to fix

Just interact with them or trigger the redstone connections, the blocks will correctly get the vanilla Noteblock texture after this.
